## 🗂️ Project Summary
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on **Acme Co.’s 2014–2018 USA Sales Dataset** to identify revenue & profit drivers, seasonal patterns, and customer segmentation.  
Findings from this analysis will be used to design a **Power BI dashboard** to support data-driven strategic decisions.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This project was created as a **learning exercise** by following a tutorial and then implementing it from scratch to understand the full workflow of data cleaning, EDA, and visualization.

## ❓ Problem Statement
Analyze Acme Co.’s historical sales data to:
- Identify top-performing products, channels, and regions driving revenue & profit.
- Detect seasonal trends and demand anomalies.
- Assess outliers impacting pricing and margin.
- Inform pricing, promotions, and market expansion strategies.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Deliver actionable insights to support **sustainable growth**.
- Build a foundation for an **interactive Power BI dashboard**.
- Provide a reusable pipeline for sales analysis.
